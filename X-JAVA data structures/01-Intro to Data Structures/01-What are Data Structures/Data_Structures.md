## What are Data Structures in JAVA?

1. Data Structures are a way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be easily accessed and manipulated.
2. They form the basis for many algorithms, which are used to solve problems efficiently.

### Why are Data Structures important?

- **Efficient data management:** Data structures enable efficient storage and retrieval of data, which is critical for many applications.
- **Algorithmic efficiency:** Data structures help in the design of efficient algorithms, which are used to solve complex problems.
- **Resource management:** Data structures enable efficient resource management, which is crucial for applications that require large amounts of memory or processing power.
- **Problem solving:** Data structures help in the development of problem-solving algorithms, which are used to solve complex problems efficiently.

### Common Data Structures

1. **Array**

    Definition: is a data structure that stores elements in a contiguous block of memory. Use cases include storing a fixed number of elements of the same type.

    Example: 

    ```java
    int[] arr = new int[5];
    ```

2. **Linked List**

    Definition: is a data structure that stores elements in a non-contiguous block of memory. Use cases include storing a variable number of elements of the same type.

    Example: 

    ```java
    LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();
    ```

3. **Stack**

    Definition: is a data structure that stores elements in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order. Use cases include storing a variable number of elements of the same type.

    Example:

    ```java 
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    ```

4. **Queue**

    Definition: is a data structure that stores elements in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. Use cases include storing a variable number of elements of the same type.

    Example: 
    
    ```java
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    ```

5. **Binary Tree**

    Definition: is a data structure that stores elements in a hierarchical structure. Use cases include storing a variable number of elements of the same type.

    Example:

    ```java 
    TreeNode root = new TreeNode();
    ```

6. **Graph**

    Definition: is a data structure that stores elements in a network-like structure. Use cases include storing a variable number of elements of the same type.

    Example:

    ```java
    Graph graph = new Graph();
    ```

### Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

The **abstract data types** are the building blocks of data structures. These types define the properties and operations that a data structure must support.

1. **List**

    Definition: is an ADT that stores elements in a contiguous block of memory. Operations include adding, removing, and accessing elements by index.

2. **Stack**

    Definition: is an ADT that stores elements in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order. Operations include push, pop, and peek.

3. **Queue**

    Definition: is an ADT that stores elements in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. Operations include enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

4. **Tree**

    Definition: is an ADT that stores elements in a hierarchical structure. Operations include adding, removing, and accessing elements by path.

5. **Graph**

    Definition: is an ADT that stores elements in a network-like structure. Operations include adding, removing, and accessing elements by path.

6. **Hash Table**

    Definition: is an ADT that stores elements in a key-value pair format. Operations include adding, removing, and accessing elements by key.
