## What is OOP?

**Object-oriented programming** is a paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which combine data and functionality. In Java, this means creating classes that define the properties and behaviors of objects.

### OOP focuses on four main principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. Encapsulation helps protect data and simplifies the interface for interacting with objects.
- **Inheritance**: Allowing a new class to inherit the attributes and methods of an existing class. This promotes code reuse and creates a natural hierarchy between classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. This allows for flexible and interchangeable object use, enhancing code adaptability.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This simplifies interaction and maintains a clear interface for users.

### Understanding Classes

**Classes** serve as blueprints for creating objects. They define the **attributes** (properties) and **methods** (behaviors) that objects will possess. For example, a House class might define attributes such as color and size, while specialized classes such as mansions or Villasilla extend this blueprint with additional features.

*Examples of Object-Oriented Concepts*

- **Designing Vehicles**: When managing various types of vehicles, encapsulation allows defining common behaviors like startEngine() in a base Vehicle class, while inheritance lets specific vehicle types like Car and Bike extend this base class with unique attributes.

- **Payment Systems**: In a payment processing system, abstraction allows defining a general Payment class with abstract methods, while concrete classes like CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment provide specific implementations.
